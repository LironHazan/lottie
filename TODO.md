Roadmap:
We aim to deliver the best and most functional Lottie's Angular based solution.

Following is what we should keep on adding: 

- expose more of lottie's custom events (like we did with enterFrame)
- install using ng add
- try to import just what needed from lottie if possible 

done:
- upgrade to angular 8 - done
- use official lottie's TS types - done
- destroy lottie's instance when component instance gets destroyed - done
- add to npm - done
- update demo app with a sentinelOne lottie example - done
- update contributing.md - done
- create better demo - done
- change fiv-lottie - done
